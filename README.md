# RPS-Multiplayer

9/15/2016
Create RPS html layout
Create naming system and insert values onto game board
Added firebase information to documents (not hooked up yet)

9/17/2016
Track wins/losses
Add chat feature
Create game logic (or copy from previous exercise)
Allow player 1 to select their move, then alert player 2 to select their move. (I'll allow both players to select whenever they want)

To Do List
Add firebase connectivity
	Only Player One is allowed to select the player one move and vice versa.
	Indicate in trashtalker which player talked which trash.
	On disconnect, clear all variables from firebase DB
	Once player enters their name the "enter name" box should disappear
In trashtalker, insert lines breaks. (This is trivial if I replace the textarea element with a standard div).



Stretch Goals
Add graphics for Rock/Paper/Scissors
Add funny/interesting game commentary
Add background image to liven things up
Add random comments to the chat feature
End of game transitions
